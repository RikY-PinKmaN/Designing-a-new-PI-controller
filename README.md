# Designing-a-new-PI-controller
Different design possibilities of a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller for a nuclear-powered vehicle is investigated. Nine different performance parameters, divided into Stability, Transient and Steady-State criterions are considered. First the Open-Loop transfer function of the system is designed, then the entire decision problem is divided into decision variables and performance space parameters subject to the requested constraints.
